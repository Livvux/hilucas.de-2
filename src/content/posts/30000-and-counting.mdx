Two of my WordPress plugins have reached 30,000 active users. Block Visibility hit this milestone at the end of November 2024, and just last week, the Icon Block followed suit. Seeing these numbers grow is both exciting and humbling.

## Block Visibility

Block Visibility was my first major WordPress plugin. It started as a simple solution to a problem I kept encountering: how do you conditionally show or hide blocks without writing custom code?

The plugin has grown significantly since its initial release, now supporting:

- User role visibility
- Date/time scheduling
- URL query string conditions
- WooCommerce integration
- And much more

## Icon Block

The Icon Block came from a different need—making it easy to add SVG icons to the block editor without complex workflows or external plugins.

## What's Next

I'm continuing to maintain and improve both plugins based on user feedback. The WordPress block ecosystem keeps evolving, and I want to make sure these tools evolve with it.

If you have feature requests or run into issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or reach out directly.
